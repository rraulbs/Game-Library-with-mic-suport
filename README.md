# Game-Library-with-mic-suport

 https://rraulbs.github.io/Game-Library-with-mic-suport/

All games in this library are known, and with extra functionality, microphone support.

The idea is to develop a game library with this simple resource. 
A disabled person or person with reduced mobility will be able to play without a joystick. 
You just have to whisper or make some noise to perform an action in the game.
